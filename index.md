# Hello, I am Katherine

I am a PhD candidate at the University of Washington, Seattle [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/) working with [Dr. Patrick Heagerty](http://faculty.washington.edu/heagerty/) on design methods related to Electronic Medical Records (EMR) data.

## Research Interests

### Broad Interests:
I am interested in creative ways to analyze large-scale biomedical data drawn from heterogeneous sources.

### Methodological/Theoretical interests:
My methodological interests involve sampling designs that are valid and resource efficient to collect labels from large-scale, heterogeneous data such as Electronic Health Records (EHR). Labels are tags associated with unstructured datas, for example medical abstraction of clinical notes. The methods I develop borrow results from machine learning, epidemiology, and experimental designs.

### Applied Interests Projects:
I have worked on Phase II and pragmatic clinical trials in with collaborators in neonatology, radiology, informatics, physical medicine and health services. I recently completed a project on designing, implementing, and evaluating a Natural Language Processing system to classify radiology report text, using tools in Python, Java and R.

# Hello, I am Katherine
I am currently serving as Quantitative Scientist at [Flatiron Health](https://flatiron.com/). I previously graduated with a PhD in Biostatistics from the[Department of Biostatistics](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/) at the University of Washington, Seattle.

## Research Interests

I am extremely passionate about research methods and processes to derive value from Electronic Health Records (EHR) data. My PhD work was motivated by radiology data (unstructured text reports; International Classification of Disease codes), and my current role involves synthesizing longitudinal data sources to generate regulatory-grade real-world evidence to accelerate oncology research.

A selection of my past projects include: 

- Sampling methods to inform labeled data collection for machine-learning classification from EHR data
- Designing, implementing, and evaluating a Natural Language Processing system to identify rare and common anatomical conditions from radiology report text
- Supporting analysis of clinical trial data in the pediatrics space

## Technical and Other Interests

I prioritize learning and improving on best coding practices for data scientists. Also, I enjoy data visualization (ggplot, rshiny) and good data storytelling.
